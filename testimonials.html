                        Saying goodbye at the airport was not easy, there isn't a day that goes by that I don't think of you. I really miss you but at the same time it makes me feel happy to see the memories we've made so far. I miss the photoshoots and night stays, that was real fun getting' ready for no reason and our way long conversations. I‚Äôm lucky enough to find a special friend,¬†you mean the World to me. YOU the one who¬†makes me believe there's really good in the world. Much love and success to you, my girlüë∏‚ù§Ô∏è
